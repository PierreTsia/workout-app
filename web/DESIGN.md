## Overview

GymLogic marketing is **dark, editorial, and precise** — a craft surface for a
serious workout product, not a fitness-influencer landing page. Near-black
canvas (`#0f0f13`), cool neutrals, one mint-teal accent (`#00c9a7`). Geist
sans throughout; Geist Mono only for code-ish scraps. Layout is calm and
narrow (`max-w-3xl` for prose, up to `max-w-5xl` for media galleries). Brand
signal is the wordmark + accent stroke icon, not a loud logo lockup.

Tone of the UI: blunt product facts, dry wit, zero urgency marketing. Big
composition through spacing and type hierarchy — not through neon, glassmorphism,
or dashboard chrome.

## Colors

- **Background (#0f0f13):** Page canvas. Never pure black.
- **Foreground (#f2f2f2):** Headlines and primary body. Soft white, not `#fff`.
- **Muted (#999999):** Supporting copy, nav idle, captions. Must stay readable
  on background (do not lighten into gray-on-gray mush).
- **Primary / Accent (#00c9a7):** Sole interactive brand color — CTAs, active
  nav underline, icon strokes, focus rings, link decoration on hover.
- **On-primary (#000000):** Text on accent buttons only.
- **Surface (#15151c):** Banded section backgrounds (e.g. feature strips).
- **Card (#1a1a22):** Interactive or contained blocks that need a lift from
  background — never for hero content.
- **Border (#2d2d37):** Hairlines, card edges, footer rules. Low contrast by
  design; do not brighten into visible grids.

## Typography

- **Font:** Geist (variable) for all UI and marketing copy. Geist Mono only for
  paths, tokens, MCP URLs.
- **H1:** ~3rem / 48px, semibold, tight tracking — one line preferred on desktop.
- **H2:** ~1.875rem / 30px, semibold — scene titles.
- **Body large:** 1.125rem for ledes under headlines.
- **Body:** 1rem, relaxed line-height (~1.65) for product-fact paragraphs.
- **No display serifs. No Inter/Roboto/Arial as the designed face.** System
  fallbacks are OK only as font-loading fallbacks.

## Layout

- **Prose column:** `max-width: 48rem` (≈768px / `max-w-3xl`), horizontal
  padding 16px.
- **Media / device row:** may widen to ~64rem (`max-w-5xl`) for phone mocks
  and galleries.
- **Vertical rhythm:** generous — scene sections ~64–96px apart; hero top
  padding ~48–80px.
- **First viewport:** one composition — brand/wordmark in header, one H1, one
  short supporting sentence, optional quiet CTA. No stats strips, no feature
  pill clusters, no secondary marketing modules above the fold.
- **Scene structure (Tour):** number or short title → 1–2 sentence product fact
  → one primary device mock (phone or desktop) with optional focal crop/zoom.
  Supporting facts as short lines under the mock — not equal card grids.
- **Sticky header:** transparent until scroll, then `background/70` + blur +
  thin border.

## Elevation & Depth

- Prefer **flat planes** (background / surface / card) over shadows.
- Primary button may use a subtle dark shadow + faint inset highlight
  (`ring-white/15`) — do not stack multi-layer neon glows.
- Device mocks: soft ambient shadow (`black/40`) only; no floating sticker
  chrome or glass panels on top of screenshots.
- Atmosphere: optional very subtle radial or vertical gradient from
  `surface` into `background` behind a device mock — never purple, never
  photographic stock-gym backgrounds as the main idea.

## Shapes

- **Radius:** 8px (`md`) for buttons and controls; 12px (`lg`) for cards and
  device frames.
- **No pill / fully-rounded buttons** as the default CTA shape.
- Device frames: rounded rectangle, thin `border` stroke, dark bezel matching
  `card` or `surface`. Phone ≈ 9:19 portrait; desktop agent scene ≈ 16:10
  window chrome.

## Components

- **Primary button:** accent fill, black label, medium radius, sm/md height.
  Label examples: `Open the app →`, not `Start free today!!!`.
- **Secondary button / outline:** border + background, foreground text — used
  for `Connect your agent`.
- **Nav links:** muted text; active = accent + underline offset.
- **Cards:** only when the container itself is the interaction (link tiles).
  Default for Tour scenes: **no cards** — title + prose + device mock.
- **Feature image card** (existing homepage pattern): image on top, title +
  subtitle below, `card` background, `border` — OK in galleries, not in hero.
- **Logo:** accent stroke “weights” icon + “GymLogic” semibold wordmark.

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do**

- Stay on the dark canvas with a single mint accent.
- Write UI copy as dry product facts (precise, a little smug about craft).
- Give each Tour scene one job and one primary visual.
- Use phone mocks for gym-floor scenes; desktop window for the BYOA/MCP scene.
- Show focal emphasis (crop/zoom) on the money UI region of a screenshot.
- Keep CTAs blunt: Open the app / Connect your agent.
- Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` — motion is optional presence, not the product.

**Don't**

- Don't use purple, indigo glow, or “AI SaaS gradient” themes.
- Don't use warm cream backgrounds, terracotta accents, or display serifs.
- Don't use broadsheet / newspaper dense column layouts.
- Don't put cards, badge stickers, or promo chips in the hero.
- Don't overlay floating labels on device media.
- Don't build a dashboard of equal feature cards for the Tour — it's a journey.
- Don't invent fake UI chrome that isn't GymLogic; placeholders should look like
  dark-mode app screenshots (teal accent, near-black surfaces).
- Don't use emoji, rounded-full pill clusters, or multi-layer neon shadows.
- Don't write sellsy urgency copy (“Limited time”, “Join thousands”).
- Don't light-mode the marketing page to “pop” against dark — the site is dark.
