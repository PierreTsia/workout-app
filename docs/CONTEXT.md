# GymLogic — Ubiquitous Language

Shared vocabulary used by the codebase, the product team, and anything we'd explain to a domain expert (a coach, a beta tester, a future-you). When you find yourself writing a term in a doc, a variable name, or a chat message, the canonical definition lives here.

> Out of scope for now: a multi-context map. Single context, single file. Split later if it grows beyond ~150 terms.

## Conventions

- **Bold** for the canonical term, exactly as it should appear in code (`PascalCase` types, `camelCase` fields) and in docs (Title Case prose).
- One-sentence definition first; expand only when needed.
- Cross-reference other terms with **bold**; never paraphrase.
- Add a `→ file:src/.../foo.ts` link when a term has an obvious code anchor.

## MCP

**Tool Annotation**:
Optional metadata block on a `ToolDefinition` exposing UI hints (`title`, `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`) to MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Le Chat). Drives the client's auto-permission behavior — read-only tools execute without confirmation prompts; destructive tools always prompt. Distinct from a tool's prose `description`, which targets the LLM, not the UI.

**MCP Public URL**:
The user-facing branded URL of the GymLogic MCP server: `https://mcp.gymlogic.me/functions/v1/mcp`. The only URL promoted in user-facing docs (skill, `docs/mcp-connect/*.md`, the eventual Anthropic Connectors Directory submission). Routed by a Cloudflare Worker fronting the **MCP Edge Function URL**.

**MCP Edge Function URL**:
The Supabase-internal URL of the GymLogic MCP server: `https://favusepjqwpcroiolvaz.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp`. Stays alive indefinitely for backward compatibility with users who installed before the **MCP Public URL** existed; not promoted in any user-facing docs after the Cloudflare proxy ships.
